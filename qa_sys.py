#### mini_qa.py
#
# A toy question-answering system, which uses Google to attempt to
# answer questions of the form "Who... ?"  An example is: "Who
# discovered relativity?"
#
# The design is a simplified version of the AskMSR system developed by
# researchers at Microsoft Research.  The original paper is:
#
# Brill, Lin, Banko, Dumais and Ng, "Data-Intensive Question
# Answering" (2001).
#
# I've described background to this program here:
